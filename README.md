Name: Pacman Codio Exercise
<br>
Description: This is MIT course code from a solution file - not my work - and is here to practice creating repositories. The code displays a pac-man image, alternates between open and closed mouth images as it moves across the page, and reverses its direction when it reaches page edge.
